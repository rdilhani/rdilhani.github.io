6. Exploring New Educational Frontiers with AI

Why It Matters:
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing education by providing personalized learning experiences, automating administrative tasks, and offering intelligent tutoring systems that adapt to individual learning needs.

Practical Activities:

AI-Powered Adaptive Learning Platforms

Example Tool: Knewton or DreamBox Learning
Activity: Engage with an adaptive learning platform that customizes lessons based on your responses. For instance, log into Knewton or DreamBox Learning and work through a series of exercises. Observe how the platform adjusts the difficulty level and provides targeted feedback based on your performance.
Intelligent Tutoring Systems

Example Tool: Socratic by Google or Duolingo
Activity: Use an intelligent tutoring app like Socratic or Duolingo for a hands-on experience. Try solving math problems with Socratic or practice a new language with Duolingo. Note how the AI provides instant explanations, hints, or corrections, and adapts to your learning pace.
AI-Enhanced Study Aids

Example Tool: Grammarly or Quizlet with AI Features
Activity: Utilize AI-powered study aids such as Grammarly for writing assistance or Quizlet’s AI features for creating smart flashcards. Write a short essay using Grammarly to see real-time grammar and style suggestions, or use Quizlet’s AI-generated flashcards to study for an upcoming test.
AI Chatbots for Learning
